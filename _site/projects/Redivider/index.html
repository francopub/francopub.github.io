<h1>Redivider 
<h2>Production editor at Redivider, literary magazine at Emerson College, 2011-2012</h2>
<main><p><em>Redivider</em> is the graduate-run biannual literary magazine at Emerson College. I was production editor, leading the design and production of the journal. My team and I designed and laid out the cover and pages for the books. </p>

<p>Additionally, I redesigned the logo for <em>Redivider.</em></p>

<em>Using the end of the R’s ears as the dots, I completed the division symbol with a bar pulled from the typeface’s division symbol</em></p>
