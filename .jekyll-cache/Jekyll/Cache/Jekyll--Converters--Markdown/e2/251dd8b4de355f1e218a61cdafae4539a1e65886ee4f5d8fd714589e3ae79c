<p>I worked with Litweaver for two years, creating over 100 ebooks for the series, which included short stories, novels, poems, and plays. I also developed a paragraph-numbering system for them. Previously they had been using non-semantic tables, which presented various problems in resizing and accessibility. To compensate for e-reader technology, instead of implementing a purely CSS3 solution, I included the numbering in the mark-up and used CSS to position the paragraphs appropriately.</p>
