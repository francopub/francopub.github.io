<article id="aboutarticle">
<p>I am a detail-oriented project manager with over a decade of proven expertise in digital product optimization and workflow enhancements.</p>
<p>I am a graduate of the University of Florida (BA in English) and Emerson College (MA in Publishing and Writing).</p>
<p>I have spearheaded major initiatives to shift workflows to more efficient digital solutions, like at Adams Media and most recently at Macmillan Learning, where my consistent efforts to align our ebooks with WCAG 2.0 AA standards enabled the company to become the first publisher to earn Benetechâ€™s Global Certified Accessible credential for all titles since 2019. As a leader, I provided culture-shifting  training and guidance to boost team proficiency across cross-functional teams, non-technical users, and external partners.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I am writing a novel, running a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, and designing my own tabletop role-playing game.</p>
