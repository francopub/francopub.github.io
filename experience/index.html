<h1>Experience, qualitative</h1>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>I have always strived to be efficient, to make the little things automatic and out of the way. Whether writing Python scripts to automate tasks or planning meals weeks in advance, I always like to make more space to create. </p>

  <h2>Brill</h2>
  <p>In February 2017, I started as project manager of reference works for Brill, an academic publisher.</p>
  
<h2>F+W Media</h2>
<p>From September 2013 to the end of January 2017, I worked at F+W Media, managing the ebook workflow and developing an CMS-based XML-first workflow for the Adams Media group, which was later sold to Simon &amp; Schuster. The CMS allowed us to leverage our content like never before, using one source for various outputs: InDesign, HTML, EPUB, and direct XML feeds for content licensing. The work at F+W allowed me to do a great deal of creative problem solving, collaborating and discussing with my colleagues, and overall making a more efficient and optimal workflow for the future.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Strangelet Press</h2>

<p>From May 2012 to the end of 2016, I and some colleagues from Emerson College ran a science fiction/fantasy literary magazine called <i>Strangelet</i>. It involved us wearing a lot of different hats, even at one point for me, coming up with a new business plan for the press. While the editors handled the words, I handled the design: the print books, the ebooks, and the website. </p>

  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-04-StrangeletWebsite %}">Strangelet Press website</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Freelance</h2>

<p>Since 2013, I have worked a variety of freelance projects. I handled the ebook development for Litweaver for two years, creating a template for their series of young adult titles. I have created a variety of titles for Wise Ink Press, among them an enhanced children&#8217;s ebook (with music). Additionally, I do freelance web design and development.</p>

  <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-01-YourDreamCakes %}">Your Dream Cakes, website</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I have a Master of Arts in Publishing and Writing from Emerson College and a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Florida. I have independently been studying web design and development since I started in publishing. Since so much of ebook development is HTML and CSS, it is a natural next step. Publishing exists not just in ink, but in pixels.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Other interests</h2>
<p>I am writing a fantasy novel, I like to play guitar, and I like cooking.</p>
